"What is a **Tapis tenant**, and what is its significance in the Tapis ecosystem?","**A Tapis tenant** is a self-contained instance of the Tapis platform [1, 2]. It represents an organizational unit or deployment of Tapis, often associated with a specific institution or user community, like the 'tacc' tenant hosted at TACC [1, 2]. Each tenant has its own set of users, resources, and security policies, providing isolation and management within the broader Tapis framework [2].","A Tapis tenant is a logically isolated view of Tapis objects (i.e., the systems, files, actors, etc.). Each tenant has a base url with which to access the tenant",0.023231912062100252,0.23376622921234616,0.06593406144185515,0.23376622921234616,tensor(0.7687)

"When creating a **Tapis system**, what is the purpose of the **`rootDir`** attribute, and why is defining it correctly critical?","The **`rootDir`** attribute of a Tapis system defines the **effective root directory** when referencing file paths through the Tapis Files or Jobs services [4]. It acts as the starting point for all relative paths used in operations like listing, copying, moving, and creating directories [4]. Defining it correctly is critical because all file paths within Tapis are interpreted relative to this directory.
