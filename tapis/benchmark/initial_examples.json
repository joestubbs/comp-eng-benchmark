        "full_answer": "Choosing to deploy an associate site versus a primary site for Tapis depends on several factors related to the administrative overhead, resource requirements, and the desired level of independence. 1) Reduced Administrative Burden and Computational Resource Requirement: Associate sites do not need to deploy all Tapis services. They can choose to run only a few critical services on-premise, while utilizing the corresponding services on the primary site for other functionalities. In contrast, primary sites must deploy a complete set of Tapis API services and all associated 3rd-party services, such as databases and message queues, which significantly increases the administrative burden and computational resource requirement. 2) Flexibility in Service Deployment: Partner institutions operating an associate site can choose which Tapis services to run within their own infrastructure and leverage the primary site's deployment for the rest. This allows them to tailor their deployment to their specific needs and resources. 3) Full Administrative Control over Local Resources: Associate sites maintain full administrative control over the Tapis services they run at their site and full administrative control over the tenants they own. 4) Leveraging Existing Primary Site Infrastructure: Associate sites can rely on the primary site for services they choose not to run locally, as well as for the unique instance of the Sites and Tenants API which maintains the complete registry of all sites and tenants. The primary site, such as the one hosted at the Texas Advanced Computing Center at tapis.io, runs a complete set of Tapis API services. 5) Easier Initial Deployment: Deploying an associate site might be less complex initially compared to a primary site, as it involves setting up fewer services. The official Tapis deployment tooling targets Kubernetes. However, it's important to note that associate sites are dependent on the primary site to be functional. If the primary site goes offline, the associate site will also not function. Additionally, the creation of new sites and the management of the site and tenant registry are coordinated through the primary site. If your institution is interested in becoming a Tapis associate site, you should contact the operators of the primary site."
